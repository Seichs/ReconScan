"""
ReconScan Vulnerability Scanner Modules

Organized collection of professional vulnerability scanners providing
comprehensive security testing capabilities across multiple attack vectors.

Each vulnerability type is organized in its own dedicated module for
better maintainability and clear separation of concerns.

Available Modules:
- sql_injection: SQL injection detection and exploitation
- xss: Cross-Site Scripting detection
- lfi: Local File Inclusion detection  
- command_injection: OS command injection detection
- directory_traversal: Path traversal detection
- security_headers: Security headers analysis

Architecture:
Each module contains its own scanner implementation, payload collections,
and specialized functionality while sharing common components from the
shared module.
